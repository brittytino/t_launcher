# T Launcher

> *Premium. Private. Productivity.*

**T Launcher** is a minimalist, digital wellbeing launcher designed to help you reclaim your focus. Built with a "Privacy First" and "Hard Mode Compatibility" philosophy, it replaces your cluttered home screen with a clean, text-based interface and powerful enforcement tools.

This project is open source and we welcome contributions from the community!

## Key Features

### 🛡️ System Surveillance
*   **Real-time Audit Log**: View a terminal-style "Live Feed" of your digital activity.
*   **Event Tracking**: Monitors strict app blocking, focus sessions, and breathing exercises.

### ⛔ Hard Mode Enforcement
*   **Strict Blocking**: Enforced 5-minute usage limits on distracting apps (Social, Games, News).
*   **Zero Loopholes**: Unlike standard Digital Wellbeing, T Launcher's rules are "Hard Mode" — no easy overrides for non-essential apps.

### 🧠 Productivity Suite
*   **Focus Timer**: Built-in Pomodoro-style timer to track deep work sessions.
*   **Breathing Exercises**: Guided breathing tools to regain mental clarity.
*   **Accountability Journal**: A daily "consistency heatmap" (GitHub style) to track diet, workout, and productivity streaks.
*   **Note to Self**: Quick, encrypted local notes.

### 🎨 Premium Aesthetics
*   **Dynamic Wallpapers**: Procedural, artistic wallpapers that change daily or on-demand.
*   **Notch-Safe UI**: Designed to look beautiful on all devices, including those with deep camera notches (e.g., Vivo V23).
*   **Minimalist Design**: Text-only home screen to reduce dopamine triggers.

### 🔒 Privacy First
*   **Offline Only**: No internet permission required.
*   **Local Data**: All your notes, journal entries, and usage stats stay on your device.
