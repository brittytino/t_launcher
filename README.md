# T_Launcher

**Minimal. Efficient. Unapologetic.**

T_Launcher is a sophisticated Android home screen designed to eliminate distractions and force productivity. Unlike standard minimalist launchers, T_Launcher actively pushes you to be better with dynamic, high-contrast wallpapers and daily motivational "rage-bait" quotes.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Motivational Engine:** Every day, a new high-contrast wallpaper is generated with a unique geometric pattern (Bauhaus, Cyber, Hexagon, etc.) and a hard-hitting quote to keep you focused.
*   **"Timebomber" Aesthetic:** A sleek, oversized clock dominates the top of the screen, ensuring you are always aware of passing time.
*   **Distraction-Free Interface:** No icons on the home screen. Only the time, the date, and the mission.
*   **Efficient App Search:** Instantly find and launch apps with a powerful search function invoked by swiping up or pressing back.
*   **Privacy-Focused:** No ads, no trackers, and compatible with work profiles.

## Visuals & Patterns

T_Launcher features a custom graphics engine that generates unique art daily:
*   **Patterns:** Includes Hexagon Hives, Bauhaus Geometry, Cyber Lines, Abstract Splatter, and more.
*   **Color Harmony:** Uses advanced color theory (split-complementary, triadic) to generate vibrant, high-energy palettes that never look dull.
*   **Rage-Bait Quotes:** Over 50+ hand-picked lines designed to destroy procrastination (e.g., "Comfort is a slow death", "Sugar is poison").
