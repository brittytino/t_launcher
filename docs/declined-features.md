# Declined Features

T_Launcher is a precise tool designed for minimalism. To maintain this focus, we strictly decline features that introduce clutter, visual noise, or unnecessary complexity.

The following features have been reviewed and **permanently declined** because they do not align with our core philosophy. Please do not open new requests for these items.

If these features are essential to your workflow, T_Launcher may not be the right tool for you. We recommend exploring other [FOSS launchers](/docs/alternatives/) that prioritize customization over minimalism.

## Daily Wallpapers

**Status: Declined**
Reason: Out of scope. This functionality is better handled by dedicated [Live Wallpaper](/docs/examples/wallpapers/) applications.

## Apps on the Home Screen / Widgets / Icons

**Status: Declined**
Reason: Violates the core text-based, list-oriented design philosophy. The home screen is for searching, not static navigation.
