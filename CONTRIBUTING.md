## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[T_Launcher Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to the project maintainers.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](docs/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/brittytino/t_launcher/issues) that might help you. In case you've found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/brittytino/t_launcher/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- Omitted: Guidelines for reporting bugs. -->

### Suggesting Enhancements

**Important: T_Launcher is strict by design.**
Before suggesting a feature, please understand that T_Launcher follows a specific philosophy: **Minimal. Efficient. Unapologetic.**

We prioritize focus and efficiency over customization. Features that add clutter, reduce friction for distracting apps, or complicate the core experience will likely be declined. This is not personal; it is to maintain the tool's integrity.

**The Development Cycle:**
1.  **Scope:** We define a small, strict scope for each iteration.
2.  **Pre-release:** Features are released early for testing.
3.  **Observation:** We observe usage and feedback.
4.  **Harden/Remove:** Features are either polished or removed if they don't fit.

When submitting a feature request:
*   Explain *why* this enhances focus or efficiency.
*   Check if it contradicts the "strict by design" philosophy.
*   Understand that "no" is a healthy answer for this project.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to T_Launcher? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/brittytino/t_launcher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/brittytino/t_launcher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue`s.
